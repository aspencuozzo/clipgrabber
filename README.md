#clipgrabber
clipgrabber is a TUI (text user interface) written in Python that allows you to batch retrieve links to clips made of a Twitch channel and send them to a text file.

**Note:** clipgrabber is in early alpha, and although it works in a basic form there are bugs to be fixed and features to be added. This project is in active development.
